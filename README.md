## Dive in A Quick Dip
- In this chapter, It was mainly discussing about the history of JAVA, How JAVA works behind the hood, and a simple syntax that could run a JAVA program.ðŸ˜Ž
- Let us start the following major chapter's topics:
    * How Java works behind the hood by the following steps:
        **Source Code** ðŸ‘‰ **Compiler** ðŸ‘‰ **Output Code (bytecodes)** ðŸ‘‰ **JAVA Virtual Machine**
        * **Source Code** -> the java code that you have written so far.
        * **Compiler** -> to check if there is any error and satisfied that your code will run successfully, Also it would create a bytecodes file.
        * **Output Code (bytecodes)** -> This could help reading and executing any JAVA bytecode file at any operating system.
    
    * simple syntax that could run a JAVA program:
        - Any statement in Java must end with semicolon.
        - varaible is declared by the type and name.
        - Any Java program must have one <mark>main() method</mark> that could start the program form it.
        - classes and methods must have opening and closing curly brackets.
        - if and loop statements must have a conditional statement, which end up in boolean result type.
        - assignment operator is one equal sign (=).
        - equal operator is double equal sign (==).
        - <mark>**Print**</mark> is to print a statement at the same line, while <mark>**Println**</mark> means to print the statement in a new line.
